# Release & Deploy Flow

How code gets from a merged PR on `main` to a running pod, for the three
deployable components (`frontend`, `backend`, `backup`). This is the contract
between this repo and your downstream FluxCD repository (for example, `bcit-tlu/flux-fleet`).

A fourth Release Please component, `synthetic-monitoring`, follows the same
image-release contract (RC images on `main`, `<component>-v<ver>` tags, digest
retag to `<ver>`/`latest`) but is **image-only — it has no Helm chart** and is
therefore not deployed by flux-fleet. Its `helm-publish.yaml` dispatch is
skipped in `release-please.yaml`, and it is absent from the `helm-publish.yaml`
and `ci.yaml` chart-publish loops. See
[synthetic-monitoring.md](synthetic-monitoring.md).

**The chart is published only on release.** Main pushes never produce a
chart artifact. This is the single biggest asymmetry in the system and
matters for the flux-fleet flow below.

## Title → release-please

Release-please reads PR titles on `main` and uses them as the sole input
for whether to open a release PR and what version bump to apply. A title
that doesn't parse as a Conventional Commit is silently dropped (workflow
still exits 0, no release PR opens). `pr-title-lint` enforces the format
at the merge boundary for human PRs.

Full title rules and rationale: [.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pr-titles-must-be-conventional-commits).

## flux-fleet side

Both environments in a downstream FluxCD repo (for example, `bcit-tlu/flux-fleet`) share the same
`OCIRepository`, `HelmRelease`, and chart (from `apps/hriv/base/`). They
differ only in the `ImagePolicy` regex and the `image.tag` value the
`ImageUpdateAutomation` writes into the env's `patch-<component>.yaml`.

### `latest` (staging)

```
OCIRepository            semver >=0.0.0
  url ghcr.io/…/charts/hriv-frontend
                │
                ▼  (polls every 5m; picks highest released chart)
HelmRelease
  chartRef → OCIRepository
  values.image.tag ← patch-frontend.yaml (set by ImageUpdateAutomation)
                │
                ▲  (rewrites image.tag whenever ImagePolicy
                │   points at a newer rc timestamp)
ImageUpdateAutomation (apps/hriv/latest)
                │
                └── ImagePolicy.hriv-frontend-latest
                       filter ^(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)-rc\.(\d{14})\.[a-f0-9]+$
                       extract $ts
                       policy numerical desc
```

**Net effect:** every main push ⇒ new rc image rolls out to `latest`
within one reconcile cycle, **but chart changes on `main` do not reach
`latest` until a release is cut.** The `latest` env always runs the
most recently released _chart_ with the most recent rc _image_.

### `stable` (production)

Same picture as `latest`, but `ImagePolicy.hriv-frontend-stable` matches
only clean `<ver>` tags (regex `^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$`, semver ordering), so
`image.tag` tracks the highest released version. `stable` runs the most
recently released chart with the most recently released image — both
change only on release.

## Consequences worth knowing

- **Chart edits on `main` are invisible to `latest`.** If a PR changes
  only `charts/<component>/...` (e.g. adding an env var to a Deployment
  template), nothing in `latest` changes until the next release of that
  component is cut. The app image rc still builds and rolls out, but
  against the previously-released chart. Any new template logic the rc
  image relies on is simply missing in `latest` until a release happens.
  This is the asymmetry called out above.
- **Retag promotion preserves image identity.** `release-retag.yaml`
  does not rebuild on release; it creates a new OCI tag pointing at the
  _same manifest_ as the `sha-<fullsha>` built on `main`. So the binary
  a `stable` pod runs is bit-identical to the rc built on `main` for
  that commit — only the displayed version string differs, because
  `APP_VERSION`/`VITE_APP_VERSION` are runtime-injected by Helm, not
  baked into the image (see `charts/<component>/templates/_helpers.tpl`
  `displayVersion` helper).
- **`pr-title-lint` skips bot-authored PRs.** Release-please's own PRs
  (author type `Bot`) bypass the lint. Without this guard every
  release-please PR would be held under "1 workflow awaiting approval"
  because `pr-title-lint` is the only `pull_request_target` workflow in
  the repo and the repo's Actions settings require approval for
  first-time contributors.
- **`release-as` is a one-shot override, not a pinning mechanism.** If
  you use it to unstick release-please, remove it once the manifest
  catches up — the staleness guard in `release-please.yaml` will fail
  the next main-push workflow until you do.

## Where to look when something breaks

| `latest` env not picking up a new main push                 | `ImagePolicy.hriv-<component>-latest` status; verify a tag matching the rc regex was actually pushed |
| `latest` env running stale chart logic                      | no release has been cut since the chart edit; cut one                                                |
| Image retag didn't happen after release                     | `release-retag.yaml` run for the release; it waits up to 30 min for the rc image, then times out     |
| Chart artifact missing for a release                        | `helm-publish.yaml` run for the release tag; parse step rejects malformed tags                       |
